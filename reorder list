https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/

You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln
Reorder the list to be on the following form:

L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …
You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.


    def reorderList(self, head: ListNode) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify head in-place instead.
        """
        myStack = []
        temp = head
        while temp:
            myStack.append(temp)
            temp = temp.next
        curr = head
        while (curr != None or curr.next != None):
            last = myStack.pop()
            if curr == last:
                curr.next = None
                break
            elif curr.next == last:
                last.next = None
                break
            next = curr.next
            curr.next = last
            last.next = next
            curr = next
